Can you help me create a plain java interface that queries the Star Wars API and returns a StarWarsCharacterDTO object? I would like to start with just one method for querying Luke Skywalker. The interface should be called StarWarsAPI. It should be in the same package.

/tests Create a test that is checking if the retrieved object from the Star Wars API is fine. It should be in the same package.

Create implementation class for StarWarsAPI interface, whith the name StarWarsAPIImpl, which will implement method getLukeSkywalker in the following way:
1. instantiate a HttpClient object
2. create a HttpRequest object using the GET method and the url https://swapi.info/api/people/1
3. send the request and retrieve the response
4. parse the response body to a StarWarsCharacterDTO object using ObjectMapper
5. return the StarWarsCharacterDTO object


Add getDarthVader method to the StarWarsAPI interface

Add implementation of getDarthVader to the StarWarsAPIImpl class same way as for getLukeSkywalker method

/tests Add test for getDarthVader method in StarWarsAPITest class same as in testGetLukeSkywalker, use implementation of the StarWarsAPI interface in the StarWarsAPIImpl class

Can you help me refactoring StarWarsAPIImpl class to use a private method getStarWarsCharacter to retrieve the payloads and avoid duplicated code in the different methods. I want to provide an Id to the private method. I need the whole refactored class as a result including the getLukeSkywalker and getDarthVaeder methods.
